    Hi there, I'm Michael Hudson, and I'm a software developer currently based out of Sydney, Australia.
</p>

<p>
  I've been developing software for a while now, and I've had some experience in various roles related to software development.
  At the moment, I'm primarily focusing on developing my functional programming skills.
