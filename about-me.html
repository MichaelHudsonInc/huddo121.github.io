    Hi there, I'm Michael Hudson, and I'm a software developer currently based out of Sydney, Australia.
</p>

<p>
  I've been developing software for a while now, and I've had some experience in various roles related to software development.
  At the moment, my big focus areas are learning team leadership skills, learning functional programming, and improved development workflows.
