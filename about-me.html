    Hi there, I'm Michael Hudson, and I'm a software developer currently based out of Newcastle, Australia. I write
    software for a living, and like to think I'm getting better at it all the time.
    My current goal is to learn how to manage small software teams in order to build something that I wouldn't be
    capable of building on my own.
</p>
<p>
    I've been studying Software Engineering at the <a href="http://www.newcastle.edu.au/" target="_blank">
    University of Newcastle</a> for many years, and for most of those I've been working full time as a software
    developer building banking software.
    This has given me quite a lot of experience with Java, including JEE, Spring, Maven and a litany of developer tools.
    Having worked on projects ranging from single developer side projects to multi-year multi-million dollar projects I've gained
    a wide array of different perspectives on project management and development practices, allowing me to have a
    somewhat unique insight in to many of the problems I face in both areas.
</p>
<p>
    Outside of work and university studies I spend a lot of my time tinkering with technology, including things like
    setting up servers, fiddling with build systems, and buying horrendously expensive keyboards.
